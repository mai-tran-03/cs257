MAI:

DONE:
- pick out color for dividing line on home html
- change cursor when hovering over clickable things (the map)
- add little icons of what the attributes & colors represent on the home page next to the
	text so that they can know what a saltire is etc & bar vs. stripe
	- continent can be left alone! 
	- in static/attribute_icons
- make country dropdown list horizontal and not vertical so then the page itself is shorter
	- search drop down wider and easier to see
- combine the imported js files into one file
- swaziland -> eswatini on datamaps
- add error handling on single country page -- hide the tables and the map
- try to swap stuff to const! 
- when single continent make sure that the other continents don't show their colors
- when page load on home js do a fetch request and make it so the hover popup works for all
	the countries from the beginning 
- make the listed header names for country as objects instead of two lists
- add other country names and flags in hover popup in single country view
- add table of countries with selected attributes, a column of flag image 
	and country name, make each clickable linking to the country info page
- resize nepal flag on country view (and maybe hover popup)
- add reset button on homepage to set the checkboxes to empty and redraw the map as empty
- think about putting <script> at the top of html? (convention to put it at the bottom....)

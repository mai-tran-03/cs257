BOTH:
- send Jeff slack dm once done with project


KEZIA:
- resize nepal flag on country view (and maybe hover popup)

- mess with the projections on home html
- fix paraguay
- add reset button on homepage to set the checkboxes to empty and redraw the map as empty
- update API documentation; and api/help/
- think about putting <script> at the top of html? (convention to put it at the bottom....)
- add top of the file comments to all js and html files
- add comments in html more 
- review all comments // read over the variable names
- webapp/readme.txt
- read over & edit css (maybe comments.....)


MAI:
- review all comments // read over the variable names


DONE:
- pick out color for dividing line on home html
- change cursor when hovering over clickable things (the map)
- add little icons of what the attributes & colors represent on the home page next to the
	text so that they can know what a saltire is etc & bar vs. stripe
	- continent can be left alone! 
	- in static/attribute_icons
- make country dropdown list horizontal and not vertical so then the page itself is shorter
	- search drop down wider and easier to see

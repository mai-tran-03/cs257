To do!

To finish before check in on Sunday June 8th

BOTH:
- send Jeff slack dm once done with project


KEZIA:
- resize nepal flag on country view (and maybe hover popup)
- add some Antartica data because it's so big OR have it hide it on the world maps
- mess with the projections on home html
- fix paraguay
- add reset button on homepage to set the checkboxes to empty and redraw the map as empty
- update API documentation; and api/help/
- think about putting <script> at the top of html? (convention to put it at the bottom....)
- add top of the file comments to all js and html files
- add comments in html more 
- review all comments // read over the variable names
- webapp/readme.txt
- read over & edit css (maybe comments.....)



MAI:
- list all the countries that were selected in home page 
	- a beautiful tables with on column as flag, one column as name
	- three tables using the three columns class where the tables are equally as possible
		filled in with the flags and countries 
	- STRETCH: (make the flags and country names as links to the country pages)
- review all comments // read over the variable names


DONE:
- pick out color for dividing line on home html
- change cursor when hovering over clickable things (the map)
- add little icons of what the attributes & colors represent on the home page next to the
	text so that they can know what a saltire is etc & bar vs. stripe
	- continent can be left alone! 
	- in static/attribute_icons
- make country dropdown list horizontal and not vertical so then the page itself is shorter
	- search drop down wider and easier to see
- combine the imported js files into one file
- swaziland -> eswatini on datamaps
- add error handling on single country page -- hide the tables and the map
- try to swap stuff to const! 
- when single continent make sure that the other continents don't show their colors
- when page load on home js do a fetch request and make it so the hover popup works for all
	the countries from the beginning 
- make the listed header names for country as objects instead of two lists
- add other country names and flags in hover popup in single country view

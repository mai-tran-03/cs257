User Testing Observations
30 May 2025

Things the testers found easy
- given a list of attributes, click a combination of options to 
explore the world map of countries with those attributes
- on the home page, hover around and click on some country on map

Things the testers had trouble with
- on the home page, most people did not see the search/drop-down 
menu to see a list of countries
- some expected something to show up on the map after selecting 
a continent option

Other positive comments or observations
- the selector box pops out and grabs testers' attention
- the hovering feature to see attributes of countries

Other suggestions for improvement
- make the search/drop-down menu more visible
    - stretch out the bar so it is more center and stands out 
    above the selector box, and/or
    - make the list of countries scrollable, contained in a box
- display attributes when hovering over countries on map even 
without selecting and submitting attributes
- display all countries with selected attributes, either above map 
or in a span/collapsible box, to see small countries/islands that 
might not be shown on map
- go back to the previous page after clicking on some country on  
map, to still see selected attributes, if any were selected
- make clickable things and its pointer, the mouse-over, into a 
cursor, which should be a CSS attribute
- turn the attributes into their corresponding visual symbols to 
make things easier for users to know what to click, instead of words

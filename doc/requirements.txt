DATASET: Our dataset is of country flags, with details about the colors and symbols on each. 
It is hosted on UC Irvine's Machine Learning site:
Flags. 1990. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C52C7Z.

STORY: A flag enthusiast who wants to see which country flags have purple on them.

IMPLEMENTATION: Checkbox menu for colors that will allow user to select purple and then 
display flags with purple. It will be displayed in a list and by coloring in those countries 
purple on a world map, the others would be gray.  

STORY: A D&D player who wants to make a fake flag can figure out if vertical or
horizontal stripes are more common. 

IMPLEMENTATION: Symbols can be selected with checkboxes and then each country will be 
colored gray for no stripes, or with a verticle/horizontal stripes, or both. 

STORY: An elementary school teacher wants to look up and show different country flags.

IMPLEMENTATION: Countries can be searched in the search bar, an image of the flag
will be displayed. It will also show the information we have on the flags (number 
of stars, stripes, colors, etc). If a non-valid country is searched, then countries
that contain that substring or similar letters will be shown.
